# TypeRacerBot

## Requirements

Defined in requirements.txt

## Installation

1. Install requirements

    ```shell script
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. [Install Tesseract-OCR](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html)

## Tutorial

1. Open [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com/)
2. Run this command to run the script:

    ```shell script
    python type_racer_reader_typer.py
    ```

3. Take a screenshot of the text you will need to type
4. Save it, in the same directory, and name it 'input.jpg'
5. Press 's', and then "Enter"
6. Select the typing textbox
7. Press Esc to start typing, then hold F9 to keep typing (typos are automatically generated!)
8. Enjoy the 2 million WPM!

Note:

* You can edit and fix any typo by editing 'result.txt' before doing step no 5
* You can reduce the `DELAY_BETWEEN_CHAR` to increase the WPM

## Caveats

* Remember though, you'll type very quickly and be prompted with an anti-cheat test. So you can't significantly lie your typing result.
   * Luckily, my highest WPM is 160 so I already passed the anti-cheat test in the previous race :D
      * That's why the anti-cheat test didn't show up in the recording
* TypeRacer is very strict with its rule, and doesn't tolerate any cheater. **You may be banned if you're logged in.** You've been warned.
   * Besides, what's the fun of abusing cheat in playing?
