Walkthrough  I've already finished this game a few months ago. this game looks great... and my Favourite Character is Reah Here's list of fusion  Orb of faint = will stone + crystal of water + ruby  Orb of weakening = power stone + Black Iron + potion  Orb of sleep = wind stone + crystal of water  Orb of death = cold iron + crystal of the earth + wine  Orb of bleeding = wind stone + HP stone  Orb of rage = power stone + crystal of fire  Orb of fatigue = HP stone + black iron  Vampire orb = HP stone + emerald + tree root  HP stone = root + platinum  Power stone = silver + platinum + wine  Will stone = wine + ruby  Wind stone = emerald + Dragon's tooth  Cold iron = black iron + potion  High potion = potion + potion        Best one to use is Vampire Orb. Also, here's a grand cheat.  Use Hestia (the first fire guardian)'s fire shield skill in a map with enemies and immediately move into a town before the skill wears out. Go pack out and your Fire Shield effect will still be there, REGARDLESS of which Guardian you use. Awesome-ness.
